# TimeSeries_Python
The workshop addresses the fundamentals of time series plotting and manipulation with Python. The objective is to provide the student with the fundamental knowledge to process, manage and visualize time series databases in Python. The workshop is divided in two sessions. 

The first session focuses on time series visualization using advanced functions in matplotlib.pyplot and seaborn. It teaches how to make aggregate plots, summary statistics plots, time series decomposition and multiple time series plotting.

The second session addresses time series manipulation. We teach how to perform webscrapping of the Peruvian Central Bank (BCRP) statistics database and Yahoo Finance by means of two libraries. Then we teach how to find the ACF and PACF, as well as how to generate some time series, such as white noise, random walk, autoregressive processes (AR) and moving average processes (MA). We present the equivalence between an AR(1) and an MA(âˆž). Finally, we show how to use the information criteria to find the best model.
